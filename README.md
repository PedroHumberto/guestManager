# Guest Manager

## The Project
I'm using this project to learn about Object Oriented, Desgin Pattern, SQLite, View Model, View Bingind and other good practices. This is the basic study about.

The project you can register Guests and mark if they're present or absent. In the main screen you can see all the guests, edit and delete them. There will be two more screens that will be implemented, one only with the presents guests and other with the absetns, filtering the guests.

## Database and plugins:
* SQLite
* View Binding
* Jetbrains
